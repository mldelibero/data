Data was taken on the leakage current of the capacitors:

0x0001
0x0002
0x0003
tantalum - need part number


voltage source: Agilent E3631A
picoammeter: Keithley 485

The setup was the voltage source in series with a 100 ohm resistor, the capacitor, and the current meter.
The voltage was stepped from 1V to 5V in 1V increments and the leakage current was allowed to stabalize before a reading was taken.
